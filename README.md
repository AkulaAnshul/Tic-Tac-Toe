# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with Python Flask backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.
This Tic Tac Toe application provides a sleek, responsive gaming experience with visual feedback and animations. The game features a clean user interface with a gradient background, animated elements, and celebratory effects when a player wins.

📋 Features
Interactive Game Board: A responsive 3x3 grid that dynamically updates as players take turns placing X's and O's.

Player Turn Tracking: Displays the current player (X or O) at the top of the screen.

Win Detection: Automatically detects winning combinations and announces the winner.

Animated Win Line: A green line connects the winning cells to highlight the victory.

Confetti Celebration: Colorful confetti launches from the bottom and sides of the screen when a player wins.

Game Reset: Allows players to start a new game at any time by clicking the "New Game" button.

Popup Notifications: Displays popups for game outcomes (winner or tie).

🔧 Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need:

Python 3.6+

Flask (Python web framework)

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

📦 Installation
1. Clone this Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install flask
🚀 Usage
Running the Application
Start the Flask server:

bash
python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5000
Playing the Game
The game starts with Player X's turn.

Click on any empty cell to place your mark (X or O).

Players alternate turns until one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the board is full.

If a player wins:

A green line connects the winning cells.

Confetti launches from the bottom and sides of the screen.

A popup announces "Winner: X" or "Winner: O."

If all cells are filled without a winner:

A popup announces "It's a tie!"

To start a new game, click on "New Game," which resets the board.

📊 Backend Logic
The backend is implemented in Flask and manages:

Game state using a dictionary of unique game IDs (games).

Player turns and board updates through /move/<game_id> route.

Win detection using predefined winning combinations in check_win().

Reset functionality through /reset/<game_id> route.

🎨 Frontend Logic
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Dynamic Grid Creation: JavaScript dynamically generates cells for the grid on page load.

AJAX Communication: Fetch API is used to send moves to the backend and update the board without reloading the page.

Visual Effects:

Animated win line calculated based on cell positions using CSS transformations.

Confetti effects using canvas-confetti library for celebrations.

Popups for displaying results like "Winner" or "Tie."

🔧 Future Enhancements
If further development is planned, consider adding:

Multiplayer functionality across devices.

AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.

Sound effects for moves and wins.

Customizable player names or symbols.

Game statistics tracking (e.g., win rates).
